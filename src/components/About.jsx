          I am a passionate web developer with a keen interest in both frontend and backend technologies. 
          Currently, I am a college student, having completed my second year of study. 
          I enjoy crafting intuitive user interfaces and solving complex backend challenges to build efficient, scalable systems.
          My projects have honed my skills in full-stack development, and I am continually learning and exploring new technologies. I am eager to leverage my diverse skills and knowledge in a dynamic development environment to create impactful digital solutions.
